# Inventory Analysis Dashboard Overview

This dashboard presents an in-depth analysis of inventory performance using **ABC** and **XYZ** methodologies, along with key inventory metrics and forecasting insights.

## ABC Analysis
- **Purpose**: ABC analysis classifies inventory based on consumption value:
  - **A** items (High Value): A small number of items with high consumption value.
  - **B** items (Medium Value): Items with moderate consumption value.
  - **C** items (Low Value): A large number of items with low consumption value.
  
  The Pareto principle (80/20 rule) applies, where A items contribute to the highest revenue but represent the smallest portion of SKU IDs.

## XYZ Analysis
- **Purpose**: XYZ analysis categorizes items based on demand variability:
  - **X** items: Low demand variability, easier to forecast.
  - **Y** items: Moderate variability, often due to known factors.
  - **Z** items: High variability, hardest to forecast.

## Inventory Metrics
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: Measures how frequently inventory is replaced. A higher ratio indicates efficient stock management.
- **Reorder Analysis**: Shows how many items are in need of reordering, contributing to stock control efficiency.

## Key Insights
- **Value Distribution**: Highlights the share of total warehouse value and SKU count by ABC category.
- **Demand Forecast**: Projects future demand based on historical data, helping in proactive stock management.
- **Top Products**: Identifies the top products under various categories (high revenue, uniform demand) based on past performance.

## Inventory Performance Breakdown
- **Warehouse Value**: Shows total inventory value in the warehouse.
- **ABC-XYZ Based Metrics**: Provides a combination of ABC and XYZ analysis for insights into both revenue and stock performance.
- **In-Stock vs. Out-of-Stock Distribution**: Illustrates the current inventory status, emphasizing items that are below reorder points or out of stock.

This dashboard provides a holistic view of inventory management by combining consumption value and demand variability, empowering businesses to optimize their stock management strategies.
